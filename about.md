## About 🔭

The name of this blog _"... a stubbornly persistent illusion."_ comes from Albert Einstein, who upon hearing of his dear friend Michele Besso's passing, wrote a letter to Besso's family which ended on the hopeful note: 

> _"Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."_

If time is fully merged with spatial dimensions as Special Relativity suggests, then the past is never gone. It is merely an address to a street we can no longer travel to.
