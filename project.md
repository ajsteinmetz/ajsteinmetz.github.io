The Project Description is the core section of your NSF SBIR proposal and typically has a maximum page limit (often 15 pages) that requires a concise, yet thorough presentation of your project’s objectives, innovation, technical plan, and anticipated results. Here’s a detailed outline to help structure this section:

---

### Project Description Outline

#### 1. **Project Objectives**
   - **Problem Statement**: Clearly define the problem your innovation addresses. Explain the scientific, technical, or societal challenge that necessitates your project.
   - **Technical and Commercial Goals**: Identify the main technical objectives of your project. For instance, what specific milestones do you intend to achieve by the end of Phase I? What commercial benchmarks are you targeting?
   - **Innovation Summary**: Provide an overview of the core innovation and explain what makes it unique compared to existing solutions or methods. Emphasize the novelty and potential impact on the field.

#### 2. **Background and Current State of the Art**
   - **Review of Existing Technologies or Solutions**: Briefly discuss current solutions, approaches, or technologies in the field and their limitations. This establishes the baseline for comparison.
   - **Scientific or Technological Gaps**: Identify gaps in existing research or technology and explain how these gaps limit progress in the field or the market.
   - **Relevance to NSF’s Goals**: Highlight how your proposed project aligns with NSF’s mission of promoting scientific discovery and supporting high-impact, transformative technologies.

#### 3. **Technical Approach and R&D Plan**
   - **A. Description of Innovation**
     - **Technical Concept**: Provide a detailed description of your innovation’s underlying technical or scientific principles. For example, if the innovation involves a novel algorithm, explain its methodology, efficiency, and scalability.
     - **Preliminary Data or Feasibility Evidence**: Include any preliminary data, feasibility studies, or theoretical proof-of-concept analyses that support your innovation’s viability.
     - **Expected Performance and Benefits**: Describe how your solution is expected to perform and the benefits it will provide over existing technologies.

   - **B. Research Plan and Methodology**
     - **Work Plan Overview**: Outline the overall structure of your work plan, breaking it into specific phases or steps.
     - **Detailed Task Descriptions**: For each phase, describe the specific tasks, methods, and experimental approaches you’ll use. For example, if your project involves materials testing, describe the testing protocols, measurement parameters, and tools.
     - **Milestones and Deliverables**: Define measurable milestones and concrete deliverables for each stage of the project. Include a timeline for these milestones, such as weeks or months to completion.
     - **Risk Management**: Identify key technical challenges or potential project risks (e.g., scalability issues, integration challenges) and explain your contingency plans for addressing these.

   - **C. Expected Results and Hypotheses**
     - **Scientific Hypotheses**: State any scientific hypotheses you will test during the project and what findings you anticipate.
     - **Expected Outcomes and Measurements**: Describe the specific technical outcomes or data you aim to generate, and the metrics or criteria you’ll use to evaluate success (e.g., performance benchmarks, yield rates, accuracy measurements).
     - **Testing and Validation**: Describe any testing or validation procedures for confirming the innovation’s performance, reliability, or scalability.

#### 4. **Commercial Potential and Societal Impact**
   - **Market Opportunity and Need**: Provide context for the market demand. Explain why the problem is commercially significant and how your solution meets a clear customer need.
   - **Customer Segments and Applications**: Define the main customer segments, such as industry sectors or end-users, and potential applications for your technology.
   - **Competitive Advantage**: Explain how your innovation differs from and improves upon existing solutions, emphasizing aspects like cost-effectiveness, scalability, performance, or usability.
   - **Path to Commercialization**: Summarize your initial commercialization strategy. This might include plans for product development, distribution channels, and partnerships with industry stakeholders.
   - **Broader Societal Impacts**: Discuss any anticipated societal benefits of your innovation, such as contributions to environmental sustainability, public health, or economic growth.

#### 5. **Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts**
   - **Intellectual Merit**: Explain how your project advances the knowledge or technological capabilities in the field. Address the scientific, engineering, or technical knowledge that the project will contribute.
   - **Broader Impacts**: Describe the broader impact of your work, such as:
     - Advancing a STEM field or contributing to cross-disciplinary research.
     - Societal or environmental benefits, like reducing pollution, conserving energy, or improving public health outcomes.
     - Creating jobs, especially if your commercialization plan involves new workforce needs.

#### 6. **Phase II Potential (if applying for Phase I)**
   - **Overview of Future Work**: Briefly outline your anticipated Phase II project goals, focusing on scaling and commercializing your innovation.
   - **Phase II Objectives and Commercialization Milestones**: Describe what additional development and validation steps would be needed to bring your product closer to market in Phase II.
   - **Long-term Vision**: Summarize the long-term impact of your technology, emphasizing its potential to transform an industry, address global challenges, or create substantial commercial value.

#### 7. **Project Timeline and Milestone Table**
   - **Timeline**: Provide a timeline that visually organizes the key tasks and milestones of the project across the proposed duration (e.g., in months or quarters).
   - **Milestone Table**: Include a table listing each milestone with corresponding deadlines, deliverables, and criteria for success. For example:

     | Task | Milestone | Expected Outcome | Timeline (Months) |
     |------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
     | Task 1 | Proof of concept | Functional prototype | 1-3 |
     | Task 2 | Testing and Validation | Performance data | 4-6 |
     | Task 3 | Optimization | Refined prototype | 7-9 |
