In physics, there is a very cool, but niche relationship between **temperature and time**. On the face of it, the two concepts have little to do with one another: Time is the parameter in which we mark the evolution of a system between events. Time is also one of the dimensions of our four-dimensional spacetime which means it is not uniquely separable from length and spatial distances. Special relativity tells us that time varies from observer to observer and that "your" time will be a mixture of space and time from another's perspective.

Temperature on the otherhand is... Well, it's actually a rather hard concept to pin down. In most people's understanding, temperature is a measure of the internal heat energy of a substance. In kinetic theory of gasses, the temperature is understood to be related to the kinetic energy via
$$
k_{B}T = \frac{1}{3}mv^{2} = \frac{2}{3}T
$$

, in both the realms of statistical mechancis, quantum theory, and general relativity
