It's easy to notice that the famous equation $E = mc^2$ bears a resemblance to the classical expression for kinetic energy $T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. This similarity might prompt the question: why doesn't Einstein's equation include the factor of 1/2 like kinetic energy does? Did Einstein overlook this factor?

**Understanding Rest Energy vs. Kinetic Energy**

First, it's important to recognize that $E = mc^2$ represents the **rest energy** of an objectâ€”the energy due to its mass when it is not in motion. In contrast, $T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ describes the kinetic energy arising from an object's motion in classical (non-relativistic) mechanics.

Einstein didn't forget the $1/2$; rather, his equation encapsulates a more comprehensive relationship between energy, mass, and momentum in the realm of special relativity. To see how the kinetic energy term with the $1/2$ factor emerges, let's delve into the full relativistic energy-momentum relation.

**The Relativistic Energy-Momentum Relation**

In special relativity, the total energy $E$ and momentum $p$ of an object with rest mass $m$ are connected through the equation:

$$E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2$$

This fundamental relation arises from the Minkowski spacetime framework and the definition of the four-momentum vector. When the object is at rest ($p = 0$), the equation simplifies to:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

which is the well-known rest energy formula.

**Expanding Energy for Small Velocities**

To bridge the gap between the relativistic and classical expressions, consider an object moving at a speed much less than the speed of light ($v \ll c$), so that its momentum $p = mv$ is much smaller than $mc$. Under this condition, we can approximate the total energy by expanding the square root in the energy equation.

Starting with

$$
E = \sqrt{m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2},
$$

we Factor out $m^2 c^4$ and write

$$
E = mc^2 \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{p}{mc} \right)^2}.
$$

Let $x = \frac{p}{mc}$. Since $x \ll 1$ in the non-relativistic limit, we can use the Taylor series expansion for $\sqrt{1 + x^2}$:

$$
\sqrt{1 + x^2} = 1 + \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^4}{8} + \ldots
$$

Neglecting higher-order terms ($x^4$ and beyond), we approximate:

$$
\sqrt{1 + x^2} \approx 1 + \frac{x^2}{2}
$$

Substituting back for $x$:

$$
E \approx mc^2 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{p}{mc} \right)^2 \right)
$$

Simplify the expression:

$$
E \approx mc^2 + \frac{p^2}{2m}
$$

**Recovering the Classical Kinetic Energy**

The first term $mc^2$ is the rest energy, and the second term $\frac{p^2}{2m}$ represents the kinetic energy in the non-relativistic limit. Using the classical expression for momentum $p = mv$, we find:

$$
KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} = \frac{(mv)^2}{2m} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

This derivation shows that the familiar $\frac{1}{2}$ factor in kinetic energy naturally arises from the relativistic energy equation when considering low velocities. The total energy in special relativity includes both the rest energy and the kinetic energy:

$$
E \approx mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$

**Conclusion**

Einstein didn't omit the $\frac{1}{2}$ factor; rather, his equation $E = mc^2$ specifically represents the rest energy of an object. The kinetic energy term with the $\frac{1}{2}$ factor emerges when we expand the relativistic energy equation for objects moving at speeds much less than the speed of light. In this non-relativistic limit, the equations of special relativity seamlessly transition into those of classical Newtonian mechanics.

Therefore, the factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ in kinetic energy is well understood within the framework of special relativity. It appears as part of the kinetic energy term when the object's momentum is small, reaffirming that classical mechanics is a limiting case of relativistic mechanics at low velocities.
