A single graviton? Almost certainly no. Here's the relevant literature that addresses this question:

* Rothman, Tony, and Stephen Boughn. "Can gravitons be detected?." Foundations of Physics 36 (2006): 1801-1825. https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0601043

* Dyson, Freeman. "Is a graviton detectable?." International Journal of Modern Physics A 28.25 (2013): 1330041. https://doi.org/10.1142/S0217751X1330041X

There's a pretty funny irony that the main difficulty of detecting gravitons even if you could build a fantastical detector the size of Jupiter (as Dyson discusses), your signal would be basically impossible to separate from the neutrino background -- a famously weakly interacting particle.

Let me quote a funny bit from Dyson's paper:

>If we imagine the whole mass of the earth to be available as raw material for the manufacture of graviton detectors, with the cross-section (21) per electron and the flux (24), the counting-rate is 2.4x10^(-17) per second. If the experiment continues for the lifetime of the sun, which is 5 billion years, the expected total number of gravitons detected will be 4. The experiment barely succeeds, but in principle it can detect gravitons.

Rothman and Boughn's prognosis are pretty clear:

>Certainly, if a “no graviton” law appears elusive, we do feel entitled to predict that no one will ever detect one in our universe.

And here's a pretty recent paper tackling the issue (though I haven't read it yet!) from an optics perspective:

* Carney, Daniel, Valerie Domcke, and Nicholas L. Rodd. "Graviton detection and the quantization of gravity." arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.12988 (2023). https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12988
