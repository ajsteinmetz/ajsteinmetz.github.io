In physics, there is a very cool, but niche relationship between **temperature** and **time**. This relationship crops up in the realms of statistical mechancis, quantum theory, black holes, gravity and spacetime. And it may offer insight into the relationship of gravity to the other fundamental interactions. On the face of it, the two concepts have little to do with one another: Time $(t)$ is the parameter in which we mark the separation between events in sequence as a system evolves while temperature $(T)$ is a measure of the internal heat energy of a substance. But if we dig a little deeper into what exactly time and temperature _are_, we'll stumble into some intriguing links.

## What is temperature?

Temperature $(T)$ is... Well, it's actually a rather hard concept to pin down. Earlier we stated that it is the heat energy of something, and that is most people's understanding. If you touch something hotter than you, the vibrating energetic molecules in that substance will transfer energy into you causing warming or even burning. In kinetic theory of gasses, the temperature of an ideal gas is understood to be related to the kinetic energy via

$$
k_{B}T = \frac{1}{3}mv^{2} = \frac{2}{3}E_{KE}.
$$

Here $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $m$ the mass of the gas, and $v$ to be the averaged speed of the particles. This is perhaps the cleanest expression of temperature as kinetic energy as we don't have any pesky intermolecular forces to get in the way like we do for non-ideal gases, liquids or solids.

## What is time?

Now that I've hopefully convinced you that temperature is actually complicated, I wish to do the same for time. As per Einstein's theory of special relativity, time is one of the dimensions of our four-dimensional spacetime which means it is not uniquely separable from length and spatial distances. Special relativity tells us that time varies from observer to observer and that "your" time will be a mixture of space and time from another's perspective.

## So how do time and temperature mix?

## How do black holes and Hawking radiation fit into this?

## What about other spacetimes?

The above is based in part on:
