<h1><i>A Elbereth Gilthoniel</i></h1>
<p>
This hymn is the longest Sindarin text in LotR, found near the end of the
chapter "Many meetings" (LotR1/II ch. 1). The hobbits are in the house of
Elrond and leave the Hall of Fire: "Even as they stepped over the threshold a
single clear voice rose in song... [Frodo] stood still enchanted, while the
sweet syllables of the elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and
melody. 'It is a song to Elbereth,' said Bilbo. 'They will sing that, and other
songs of the Blessed Realm, many times tonight.' " In Letters:278, Tolkien
calls it a "hymn-fragment", suggesting that what we have is only one stanza of
many.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  The hymn is nowhere translated in LotR, except for the words <i>galadhremmin
Ennorath</i> that are interpreted "tree-woven lands of Middle-earth" in the
second footnote in Appendix E.  However, Tolkien provided a translation of this
song in RGEO:72, followed by some illuminating comments. This is the main
source for this article.<p>

In RGEO, Tolkien compared this hymn to the invocation uttered by Sam "speaking
in tongues" in Cirith Ungol (LotR2/IV ch. 10: "then his tongue was loosed and
his voice cried in a language which he did not know"...). We follow his example
and will analyze this short utterance here as well. Notes Tolkien in
Letters:278, "Though it is, of course, in the style and metre of the
hymn-fragment [<i>A Elbereth Gilthoniel</i>], I think it is composed or
inspired for his [Sam's] particular situation".<p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<i></i>  [The hymn:] "O! Elbereth who lit the stars, from glittering crystal
slanting falls with light like jewels from heaven on high the glory of the
starry host. To lands remote I have looked afar, and now to thee, Fanuilos,
bright spirit clothed in ever-white, I here will sing beyond the Sea, beyond
the wide and sundering Sea."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  [Sam's invocation:] "O! Queen who kindled star on star, white-robed from
heaven gazing far, here overwhelmed in dread of Death I cry: O guard me,
Elbereth!" Another translation, more literal, is given in Letters:278: "O
Elbereth Starkindler from heaven gazing-afar, to thee I cry now in the shadow
of (the fear of) death. O look towards me, Everwhite."<p>
<h2>WORD-BY-WORD ANALYSIS</h2>
<i>  Superscript: Aerlinn in Edhil o Imladris</i>. Nowhere translated by
Tolkien, but evidently meaning "Holy song (hymn) of the Elves of Rivendell".
<b>Aerlinn</b> is transparently an element <i>aer</i> *"holy" + <i>lind</i> "tune, *song", that may appear as -<i>linn</i> in a compound (but *<i>aerlind</i> would also have been possible). <b>in</b> "the", plural.
<b>Edhil</b> "Elves" (sg. <i>Edhel</i>). The phrase <i>in Edhil</i> is to be
understood as a genitive, "<i>of</i> the Elves". It is not marked as a genitive
by means of any ending or prefix, but simply by its position following another
noun, <i>aerlinn</i>. (In the singular, Sindarin has a special "genitival"
article, <i>e</i> or <i>en</i> "of the", but in the plural <i>in</i> is used
whether the noun is a genitive or not.) <b>o</b> "of, from", <b>Imladris</b>
"Rivendell". In RGEO:72, Tolkien notes that the language of this hymn is
"Sindarin, but of a variety used by the High Elves (of whose kind were most of
the Elves in Rivendell), marked in high style and verse by the influence of
Quenya, which had been originally their normal tongue". As examples of Quenya
borrowings he lists the words <i>menel</i>, <i>palan</i>- and <i>le</i> (see
below); we may add one more: The <i>aer</i> *"holy" of <i>aerlinn</i> is
may be a Sindarized form of Quenya <i>aira</i>, <i>air&euml;</i>, for
these Quenya words come from a stem <i>GAYA</i> (PM:363) that would not have
lost its initial <i>G</i> in Sindarin if <i>aer</i> had been an inherited word. However, another possible interpretation of this element is that it comes from <i>aear</i> "sea", hence <i>aerlinn</i> = *"sea-song", since the Elves sometimes went on pilgrimages to Emyn Beraid, close to the ocean. It may even be that the word is deliberately ambiguous.
<p>
<i>  The hymn:</i> <b>A </b>"o", here evidently used as a vocative particle.
<b>Elbereth</b> the normal Sindarin name of Varda. The element <i>el</i>- means
"star", while <i>bereth</i> according to RGEO:74 means "spouse", used of the
spouse of a king, hence coming to mean "queen". Varda is both the Queen of the
Valar and the spouse of Manw&euml;; in Letters:282 <i>Elbereth</i> is
translated "Star-lady". Why is <i>bereth</i> is not lenited to *<i>vereth</i>
in <i>Elbereth</i>, though the second element in a compound would normally be
lenited? Tolkien addressed this question in MR:387: It is because the element <i>el</i>- "star" was originally <i>elen</i>, as in Quenya, and so we have older <i>Elenbarathi</i> yielding<i> Elmbereth</i>, simplified to <i>Elbereth</i>, older <i>lmb</i> becoming <i>lb</i> instead of <i>lv</i>. Note that the word <i>Elbereth</i> is not directly related to Quenya <i>Varda</i> "Lofty, Sublime" (the Quenya form of <i>Elbereth</i> would have been something like *<i>Elenvarsi</i>, while the Sindarin cognate of <i>Varda</i> would have been *<i>Baradh</i> or possibly *<i>Bradh</i>, but there is no evidence that these forms were in use as names of the Starqueen).
<b>Gilthoniel</b> "Star-kindler": <i>Gil</i> "bright spark, star" (as in
<i>Gil-galad</i> "Star of Radiance") + <i>thoniel</i> "kindler". In MR:388, the
latter element is said to come from a stem <i>than</i>, <i>th&acirc;n</i>
"kindle, set light to" + <i>iel</i> "a feminine suffix corresponding to male
-<i>we</i>". (Sindarin <i>th</i> cannot undergo any lenition and is therefore
unchanged when <i>gil</i>- is prefixed.) In Letters:278, <i>Gilthoniel</i> is
translated "Starkindler", but Tolkien added a note: "in the past tense: the
title belongs to mythical pre-history and does not refer to a permanent
function". So somehow <i>thoniel</i> is marked as past tense "one having
kindled" instead of "one who is kindling (now)". If we see it as a participle,
displaying the same ending as in <i>palan-d&iacute;riel</i> "having gazed far"
later in the hymn (as opposed to present tense <i>palan-diriel</i> "gazing far"
in Sam's invocation), it should have a long vowel in the past tense. Since the stem is given as <i>than</i>-, <i>th&acirc;n</i>- in MR:388, not *<i>thon</i>-, we are evidently to understand that long <i>&aacute;</i> (<i>&acirc;</i>) became <i>o</i> (via <i>au</i>). Many parallels show this to be the case; for instance, Sindarin <i>Anor</i> "Sun" comes from <i>an&acirc;r</i>- (LR:378, stem <i>AN&Aacute;R</i>). 
<b>silivren</b> "glittering (white)".
The -<i>ren</i> part is an adjectival ending, while <i>siliv</i>- is a
Sindarized form of Quenya <i>silima</i>, F&euml;anor's name for the special
crystalline substance that he devised, using it to make the Silmarils. Tolkien
noted that the word <i>silivren</i> "would recall to Elvish minds the
<i>silmarils</i> and describe the stars as crystalline forms shining from
within with a light of mysterious power" (RGEO:73). Here, <i>silivren</i> is
apparently used adverbially, describing <i>how</i> "the glory of the star-host"
(see below) is 'slanting down'. <b>penna</b> a verb "slants", here with the
ending -<i>a</i> that A-stem verbs show in the present tense. It must be derived from a nasal-infixed form of the stem <i>PED</i> "slope, slant down" (WJ:375). The subject of
this verb seems to be <i>aglar elenath</i> "the glory of the star-host"; see
below. <b>m&iacute;riel</b> adj. "sparkling like jewels" (compare
<i>m&icirc;r</i> "jewel", Quenya <i>m&iacute;r&euml;</i>). <i>M&iacute;riel</i>
looks almost like a participle, but for various reasons it must rather be taken
as an adjective (with a long vowel it should have meant "<i>having sparkled</i>
like jewels" if it were a participle, but this is clearly not the meaning, so
we must rather assume that it simply preserves the long vowel of
<i>m&icirc;r</i>). Here, <i>m&iacute;riel</i> (like <i>silivren</i>) is used
adverbially, describing <i>how</i> "the glory of the star-host" (see below) is
'slanting down'. <b>o</b> "from"; <b>menel</b> "firmament, high heaven, the
region of the stars" (according to RGEO:72 a borrowing from Quenya).
<b>aglar</b> "glory", <b>elenath</b> "(the) star-host", "(all) the (visible)
stars of the firmament". In WJ:363, Tolkien states: "<i>&ecirc;l</i>, pl.
<i>elin</i>, class plural <i>elenath</i>. An archaic word for 'star', little
used except in verse, apart from the form <i>elenath</i> 'all the host of the
stars of heaven'." In RGEO:74-75, Tolkien explains that the ending -<i>ath</i>
"was used as a group plural, embracing all things of the same name, or those
associated in some special arrangement or organization" (RGEO:74-75). The whole
phrase <i>aglar elenath</i> "(the) glory (of the) star-host" is an example of
the Sindarin "genitival" construction that simply involves the juxtaposition of
two nouns, the possessed followed by the possessor: "(the) glory (of the)
star-host". Cf. <i>aerlinn in Edhil</i> "hymn (of) the Elves" in the
superscript; cf. also the inscription on the gate of Moria: <i>Ennyn Durin Aran
Moria</i> "Doors (of) Durin King (of) Moria".<b> Na-chaered</b> "to a remote
distance": <i>na</i>- "to" + *<i>haered</i> "remote distance" (compare the
Quenya adjective <i>haira</i> "remote, far"); *<i>haered</i> is lenited to
<i>chaered</i> following the prepositional element <i>na</i>-.
<b>palan-d&iacute;riel</b> "having gazed far": <i>palan</i>- "afar, abroad, far
and wide", an element borrowed from Quenya (occurring in
<i>palant&iacute;r</i>, "that which watches from afar"); -<i>d&iacute;riel</i>
lenited form of <i>t&iacute;riel</i> "gazing, watching", participle of
<i>tir</i>- "watch". It is lenited as the second part of a compound. According
to Tolkien, <i>palan-d&iacute;riel</i> with a long stem-vowel (<i>&iacute;</i>)
means "having gazed far away" (in the past), while <i>palan-diriel </i>as in
Sam's invocation, with a short <i>i</i>, means "gazing away" (now). The
distinction is past vs. present. - The stem <i>tir</i>- "watch" is of course
the same as in Quenya <i>palant&iacute;r</i>. Indeed the whole phrase
<i>palan-d&iacute;riel</i> is intended to suggest "having looked into a
palant&iacute;r", since this is a hymn sung by Elves that had been on a
"pilgrimage" to the Emyn Beraid to look towards the Blessed Realm using the
Seeing Stone there. - One may ask why the final <i>n</i> in <i>palan</i>, when
prefixed to <i>t&iacute;riel</i>, does not cause nasal-mutation - sc. <i>n</i> + <i>t</i> becoming <i>th</i>, as when the underlying phrase *<i>in
tiw</i> "the runes" manifests as <i>i thiw</i> in the Moria gate inscription.
Instead of nasal mutation, the <i>t</i> of <i>t&iacute;riel</i> undergoes
lenition (soft mutation) to become <i>d</i>, producing
<i>palan-d&iacute;riel</i>. Tolkien addresses this question in Letters:427:
"<i>palan-t&icirc;riel</i> should phonetically &gt;
-<i>th&iacute;riel</i>...but grammatically before actual forms of verbs, the
soft mutation only was normally used in later S[indarin], to avoid the
confusion with other verb stems". <b>o</b> "from".<b> galadhremmin
</b>"tree-tangled": <i>galadh</i> "tree" + <i>remmin</i> "tangled". This is an
adjective derived from <i>rem</i> "mesh"; see the second footnote in Appendix E
to LotR. <i>Remmin</i> is the plural form of this adjective; the singular form
would be *<i>remmen</i>. It is pl. to agree with <b>ennorath</b>, translated
"middle-lands" in RGEO:72. Actually it is <i>Ennor</i> "Middle-earth"
(*<i>en</i>- "middle" + <i>nor</i> "land"; Quenya <i>Endor</i>,
<i>End&oacute;r&euml;</i>) with the collective ending -<i>ath</i> as in
<i>elenath</i> above, hence referring to the different lands of Middle-earth as
a group. <b>Fanuilos</b> is translated "Ever-white". There are three elements:
<i>F&acirc;n</i>, <i>fan</i>- means "veil", but also connotes the Quenya
cognate <i>fana</i>, used of the physical shapes that the Valar put on when
presenting themselves in visible form. <i>Ui</i> means "ever", while
-<i>los</i> must be a lenited and reduced form of <i>gloss</i>, "snow-white".
The whole, Tolkien explains, therefore means "bright (angelic) figure ever
white (as snow)" (RGEO:74). A slightly different explanation is given in
Letters:278; here the element <i>fan</i>- is also said to mean "white":
"<i>Everwhite</i> is an inadequate translation, as is
equally...<i>show-white</i>... The element <i>ui</i> (Primitive Elvish
<i>oio</i>) means <i>ever</i>; both <i>fan</i>- and <i>los(s)</i> convey
<i>white</i>, but <i>fan</i> connotes the whiteness of clouds (in the sun);
<i>loss</i> refers to <i>snow</i>." <b>le </b>"to thee", a pronoun borrowed
from Quenya (in which language it was probably not a dative form, but rather an
accusative and/or nominative; in High-elven, "to thee" would probably be dative
*<i>len</i> or allative *<i>lenna</i>). It is possible that <i>le</i> can also
be used as an accusative in Sindarin and was originally borrowed as such.
<b>linnathon</b> "I will sing": Stem <i>linna</i>- "sing" + the future-tense
ending -<i>tha</i> "will" + the ending -<i>n</i> "I", that causes a preceding
<i>a</i> to become <i>o</i>. Compare <i>nallon</i> in Sam's invocation below;
cf. also <i>linnon</i> *"I sing" in <i>The Lays of Beleriand</i> p. 354.<b>
nef</b> is a preposition "on this side of". It is pronounced <i>nev</i> and is
so spelt in Tengwar writing, but Tolkien had a strange horror of final
orthographic <i>v</i>'s, so when writing Sindarin with our letters he used the
letter <i>f</i> instead, as in English <i>of</i> ("ov"). The "correct" spelling
is used when <i>v</i> is not final, as in the name <i>Nevrast</i> "Hither
Shore" in the <i>Silmarillion</i>.<b> aear</b> "ocean, sea" (Quenya
<i>&euml;ar</i> as in <i>E&auml;rendil</i>). In Tolkien's later conception,
<i>aear</i> must be seen as a lenited form of <i>gaear</i>, lenited because it
follows the preposition <i>nef</i> (just like *<i>haered</i> is lenited to
<i>chaered</i> following <i>na</i>). But the evidence is that when Tolkien
originally wrote the hymn, he thought of <i>aear</i> as a complete word, not as
<i>gaear</i> with the normal lenition <i>G</i> &gt; zero. In the
<i>Etymologies</i>, the word for "sea" had been <i>oear</i>, derived from a
stem <i>AYAR</i>/<i>AIR</i>. Tolkien later revised the sound-changes so that
this would become <i>aear</i> instead. But in an essay dating from about 1960,
Tolkien derived the Sindarin word for "sea" from a stem <i>GAYA</i> instead, so
now it became <i>gaear</i> (WJ:400). Then he reverted to the stem <i>AYAR</i>
yielding Sindarin <i>aear</i>, as is evident from a letter he wrote in 1967
(Letters:386). Then he changed his mind <i>again</i>; in a text written at
least one year later, the Sindarin word for "sea" is once again <i>gaear</i>
(PM:363), and as far as we know, this was his final decision. (However, I
wouldn't be surprised if it turns out that a note with some doodles was found
near his deathbed: "<i>AYAR</i> sea; Q <i>&euml;ar</i>, S <i>aear</i>.")
<b>s&iacute;</b> "here",<b> nef</b> "on this side of" again, <b>aearon</b> must
be seen as a lenited form of <i>gaearon</i>, sc. <i>gaer</i> with what Tolkien
calls an augmenting suffix (RGEO:73). If <i>gaer</i> is simply "ocean",
<i>gaearon</i> is "Great Ocean" (RGEO:72). Just as in the case of <i>aear</i>,
there is little doubt that Tolkien thought of <i>aearon</i> as a complete word
in itself, not a lenited form, when he first wrote the hymn. (If we don't see
<i>aear</i>, <i>aearon</i> as lenited forms, they must be explained as variants
of <i>gaear</i>, <i>gaearon</i> influenced by Quenya <i>&euml;ar</i>.)<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Then there is Sam's invocation in Cirith Ungol:<i></i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<i>  </i>First sentence: <i>A Elbereth Gilthoniel, o menel palan-diriel, le
nallon s&iacute; di-nguruthos!</i> "O Elbereth Starkindler, from heaven gazing
far, to thee I cry now beneath the shadow of death." <b>A Elbereth
Gilthoniel</b> "o Elbereth Starkindler" as in the hymn (the first edition of
LotR had <i>o</i> <i>Elbereth</i> instead of <i>a Elbereth</i>; this was an
error that Tolkien later corrected, see Letters:278). <b>o</b> "from".<b> menel
</b>"firmament" as in the hymn above. <b>palan-diriel</b> "gazing far", same
elements as in <i>palan-d&iacute;riel</i> "having gazed afar" above, but here
the stemvowel is not lengthened (<i>i</i>, not <i>&iacute;</i>), and this
somewhat flimsy device indicates that this participle is present tense "gazing
far" instead of past tense "having gazed afar". (Early editions of LotR
actually read <i>palan-d&iacute;riel</i> with a long vowel instead of
<i>palan-diriel</i>; this is an error, according to a footnote in RGEO:72.)
<b>le </b>"to thee" as in the hymn. <b>nallon </b>"I cry", evidently a verbal
stem *<i>nalla</i>- "cry" with the pronominal ending -<i>n</i> "I". For some
reason, this ending always causes a preceding -<i>a</i> (for present tense as
here, or as part of the future-tense ending -<i>tha</i>) to change to
-<i>o</i>, hence "I cry" is <i>nallon</i> rather than **<i>nallan</i>, just
like "I will sing" is <i>linnathon</i> rather than **<i>linnathan</i> (see
above). Cf. also <i>linnon</i> *"I sing" in <i>The Lays of Beleriand</i> p.
354, stem *<i>linna</i>-. <b>s&iacute;</b> "here", as in the hymn; also
translated "now" (Quenya <i>s&iacute;</i> "now").<b> di-nguruthos</b> "beneath
death-horror". So it is spelt in RGEO:72; LotR has <i>di'nguruthos</i> with an
apostrophe instead of a hyphen. The "normal" (that is, unmutated) form of
<i>-nguruthos</i> would be *<i>guruthos</i>. The first element of this compound
is plainly <i>guruth</i> "death" (LR:377, stem <i>&Ntilde;GUR</i>). According
to the <i>Etymologies</i>, this should mean "death as a state or abstract"
rather than "act of dying" (that is <i>gwanw</i> or <i>gwanath</i>), but Sam
would be concerned with the possibility of his own "act of dying" rather than
death as an abstract, so it seems that <i>guruth</i> here takes on the meaning
of <i>gwanw</i> (which, by the way, should rather be *<i>gwanu</i> in LotR-style Sindarin). The final element in *<i>guruthos</i> is evidently the same as
in <i>delos</i> "abhorrence", where <i>del</i>- represents the stem <i>DYEL</i>
"feel fear and disgust" and the -<i>os</i> part is equated with <i>gos</i>
(LR:355), <i>g</i> leniting to zero in the compound. <i>Gos</i> in turn
connects with the stem <i>GOS</i>/<i>GOTH</i> "dread", whence Quenya
<i>oss&euml;</i> "terror" - which word is also the name of the Maia
<i>Oss&euml;</i>, according to the <i>Etymologies</i>. An unused Sindarin
cognate of the name <i>Oss&euml;</i> is given as *<i>Goss</i>, so we can
conclude that <i>gos</i>, <i>goss</i> means "terror, *horror", giving
*<i>guruthos</i> the meaning "death-horror". This is how Tolkien translated it
in RGEO:72, while Letters:278 has "the shadow of (the fear of) death"; no
word meaning "shadow" is actually present. The prefixed element <i>di'</i> or
<i>di-</i> is translated "in" in Letters:278, but the more literal translation
in RGEO:72 seems to indicate that it actually means "beneath". This prefixed prepositional element
is somehow responsible for the fact that *<i>guruthos</i> here manifests as
<i>nguruthos</i>. There are two possibilities. Since <i>guruth</i> comes from a
stem <i>&Ntilde;GUR</i>, initial <i>ng</i>- reflecting the original initial nasalized stop would appear following closely related particles ending in a vowel, such as the article (*<i>i nguruthos</i> "the death-horror"). There may be a preposition <i>di</i> "beneath" that behaves like the article <i>i</i> "the" in this respect. On the other hand, the preposition may also be *<i>din</i>, and the final <i>n</i> causes nasal mutation of the initial <i>g</i> of *<i>guruthos</i>. Does the ' of <i>di'nguruthos</i> suggest that the final <i>n</i> of *<i>din</i> has disappeared, being swallowed up in the nasal mutation? (If so, a more standard spelling would have been simply *<i>din Guruthos</i>; compare <i>in Gelydh</i>, not <i>i'Ngelydh</i>, for "the Noldor".) Following the apostrophe, we might have expected a space clearly separating the words (*<i>di' nguruthos</i>), but there seems to be no space in the text in LotR.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Second sentence: <i>A tiro nin, Fanuilos!</i> "O look towards me,
Everwhite".<b> A </b>"o", not here used as a vocative particle as in <i>a
Elbereth</i>, but rather as a particle emphasizing the following imperative:
<b>tiro</b> "look" or "watch": stem <i>tir</i>- with the normal imperative
ending -<i>o</i>. According to Letters:427, this imperative in -<i>o</i> covers
all persons (no distinct plural form: one Elf cried <i>daro!</i> "halt!" to the
entire Fellowship as they were entering L&oacute;rien; see LotR1/II ch. 6).
Early editions of LotR read <i>t&iacute;ro</i> with a long <i>&iacute;</i>, but
according to RGEO:72 this is an error. <b>nin</b> is translated "towards me".
The first element of this pronoun is clearly identical to Quenya <i>ni</i> "I";
the final -<i>n</i> could be what remains of the primitive element <i>na</i>
"towards" after the loss of the final vowels (cf. the stem
<i>N&Acirc;<sup>1</sup></i>  in the <i>Etymologies</i> and the <i>na</i> of
<i>na-chaered</i> "to remote distance" in the hymn). This would give <i>nin</i>
the meaning "I-towards" = "towards me".<b> Fanuilos</b> "Everwhite" again.
<p>
<i>Note on the mutations following the preposition </i>o<i> "from,
of":</i>
As this hymn illustrates, many Sindarin prepositions trigger <i>lenition</i>,
also known as "soft mutation", of the following word. *<b>Haered</b> becomes
<b>chaered</b> following <b>na</b>, and <b>gaear</b>/<b>gaearon</b> becomes
<b>aear</b>/<b>aearon</b> following <b>nef</b>. But what about the preposition
<b>o</b> "from, of"?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  In the phrase <b>o Imladris</b> "from Rivendell" in the superscript there is
of course no mutation since words beginning in a vowel cannot undergo any such
change. But it is remarkable that there is no lenition in the phrases <b>o
menel</b> and <b>o galadhremmin ennorath</b>. We might have expected **<b>o
venel</b> and **<b>o 'aladhremmin ennorath</b> instead, the words following
<b>o</b> being lenited. This does not happen. Why?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Notes Tolkien in WJ:366-367, "The preposition <i>o</i> [is] the usual word
for 'from, of'... As the mutations following the preposition <i>o</i> show, it
must prehistorically have ended in -<i>t</i> or -<i>d</i>. Possibly, therefore,
it comes from *<i>aud... </i>[The preposition <i>o</i>] is normally <i>o</i> in
all positions, though <i>od</i> appears occasionally before vowels, especially
before [words beginning in] <i>o</i>-."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  We must assume that before voiced sounds like the <b>m</b> of <b>menel</b>
and the <b>g</b> of <b>galadh</b>, the final <i>d</i> of <i>aud</i> was simply
assilimated to a similar sound, *<i>aum m</i>- and *<i>aug g-</i> later being
simplified to <b>o g</b>- and <b>o m</b>- as in <b>o galadh</b>, <b>o
menel</b>. Therefore, words beginning in <b>m</b> or <b>g</b> (and probably
other voiced sounds like <b>d</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>l</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>n</b>) are
unchanged following the preposition <b>o</b>. But since Tolkien refers to "the
mutations following the preposition <i>o</i>" in WJ:366, something interesting
sometimes does happen following <b>o</b>. We have no direct examples of what he
means, but what we generally know about Sindarin phonology and its evolution
suggests that <b>o</b> triggers <i>spirant mutation</i> of nouns beginning in
the unvoiced plosives <b>p</b>-, <b>t</b>-, <b>c</b>-. Before a noun like
<b>perian</b> "halfling, hobbit", the <i>d</i> of <i>aud</i> would be
assimilated to the following <i>p</i>, so that <i>aud</i> became *<i>aup</i>.
Then the double <i>p</i> of *<i>aup perian</i>, like all other double
<i>p</i>'s, became a single spirant <b>ph</b> (= <i>f</i>) in Sindarin. "From
(a) hobbit" would therefore probably be *<b>o pherian</b>. Similarly, <b>c</b>
and <b>t</b> would become spirants <b>ch</b> and<b> th</b> following the
preposition <b>o</b>. (In a poem published in <i>Tyali&euml;
Tyelelli&eacute;va</i> #11, David Salo translated "from Celos" as <b>o
Chelos</b>.) <p>
